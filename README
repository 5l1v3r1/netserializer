NetSerializer - A fast, simple serializer for .Net

NetSerializer is a simple and very fast serializer for .Net languages. It is
the fastest serializer I have found for my use cases.

- Excellent for network serialization
- Supports classes, structs, enums
- No versioning or other extra information is serialized, only pure data
- No type IDs for primitive types, structs or sealed classes, so less data to be sent
- No dynamic type lookup for primitive types, structs or sealed classes, so deserialization is faster
- No extra attributes needed (like DataContract/Member)

Usage is simple. The types to be serialized need to be marked with the standard
[Serializable].  You can also use [NonSerialized] for fields you don't want to
serialize.

Then you need to initialize NetSerializer by giving it a list of types you will
be serializing. NetSerializer will scan through the given types, and create
(de)serializers for found types.

Initialization:

	NetSerializer.Serializer.Initialize(types);

Serializing:

	NetSerializer.Serializer.Serialize(stream, ob);

Deserializing:

	(YourType)NetSerializer.Serializer.Deserialize(stream);
